👋 Hello, I'm Dhirar Zoghlami, a relentless learner and aspiring Front-End Web Developer on a mission to craft seamless digital experiences.

🚀 Currently navigating my third year as a Computer Science student, I've come a long way from Pharmaceutical Studies to the dynamic realm of IT. My journey involves a fusion of database administration, website design, and a deepening love for web development.

💻 In the coding trenches, I began by mastering procedural programming with C, even fashioning a 2D game using SDL. The evolution continued with a dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++, resulting in a robust Desktop Application for data management built with Qt. Recently, my focus has shifted to the enchanting world of front-end web development, where I'm wielding HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP8 to sculpt user-centric websites.

🌟 Proficient in:
VCS (Version Control) with Git & GitHub
Crafting and Implementing Algorithms
Harnessing Microsoft Office Word & PowerPoint

💪 Personal Skills:
Collaborative Teamwork
Resilience: Thriving under pressure
Effective Time Management and Prioritization
Problem-Solving with Strategic Goal Setting
